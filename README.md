# epic1-midterm-output
Wazzup! This repository is for my midterm output which is the epic1-midterm-output.
I am Glaiza Gynn S. Marmolejo from BSCS 1-A. 
I offer you all my Mandala Activity, inspired by circle patterns. 
I decided to use the typical circle shapes because even if it's simple we still made an awesome output out of it.
The concepts that I got are from the YT channels, [cybercode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KqrnwJt4Z4), and as well as from [Geek Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KqrnwJt4Z4). 
I am grateful for their excellent videos that I am able to make an awesome spirograph pattern.
